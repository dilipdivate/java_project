//	Important points to remember while implementing object serialization in java:
//		Serializable is a marker interface â€” it does not consist of any methods or data members. If a java class implements a Serializable interface it gets certain capabilities. It is also important to note that objects of a class can only be serialized if the class implements the Serializable interface.
//		Only non-static members of a class are serialized. Static members and transient data members are not serialized.
//		If the parent class has implemented serializable the child class does not need to implement it.
//		Associated objects must implement the Serializable Interface.
//		The constructor of an object is never called when deserialization takes place.
